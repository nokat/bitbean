What Is BitBean?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bitbeans (Ticker: BITB) is a new Digital Currency, designed for scale-ability,
speed, and lightening fast transactions! It features an innovative Proof of Sprout
algorithm that more closely resembles traditional Proof of Work crypto currencies.
BitBean is the first crypto to impliment 20MB blocks, based off Gavin Andersen's
proposals to fix Bitcoin's scale-ability limitations.
BitBean is designed from the ground-up to be transaction-centric and superior form
of currency for on-line and brick-and-mortar businesses. Inovative new implimentations
are planned for BitBean that will set it appart from the rest of the crypto curriencies
and lead in the mass adoption of crypto curriencies in the market place.


Why BitBean?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is the goal of the BitBean developers (Bean Core) for everyone involved in the
Cryptocurrency revolution to have access to the exciting developments that have
been taking place. An ASIC-friendly, mixed PoW/PoS bean with eventual anonymous
transaction capabilities has been sorely overlooked.

The BitBean developers believe that progress should never be held back.
Proof of Sprout Crypto-currencies use a considerably smaller amount of energy and
allows everyone to be involved in the network, without prohibitively expensive
propriatary hardware as required to mine Bitcoin. The energy used mining Scrypt
beans for years to prolong the days of GPU mining was a truly enormous waste of
resources on a global scale. Why hold back progress? BitBean encourages it,
allowing everyone with even a small investment in BitBean to participate in the
network and currencies success!
